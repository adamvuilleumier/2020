Command:                                  Result:
 
/usr/bin/ls --version                     Gets version of Coreutils: 8.22
mkdir and cd 35L-a4                       Makes directory and enters it
touch .foo, .bar, foobar                  Creates sample files
/usr/bin/ls -A -a                         Outputs all files, including unwanted . and .., verification complete

I now downloaded the coreutils tarball, its signature, and the GNU keyring and put them in my 35L-a4 directory using Filezilla.

gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig   Verifies signature -

gpg outputs a warning that this key is not certified with a trusted signature. I suspect that this is an issue because Padraig
Brady, the source of the signature, has not yet been verified by the Certification Authority.

tar -zJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz            Extracts the source code from tarball
cd coreutils-8.29                          Enters newly made directory
./configure --prefix="/35L-a4/coreutils-8.29/configure/"    Compiles and installs coreutils into coreutils-8.29 directory
make                                       Compiles the c code in coreutils-8.29
make install                               Installs the programs

cd coreutils-8.29                         Get into coreutils directory so it is stdin
patch -p1 coreutils-8.29/src/ls.c  bugfix.diff   Applies the patch to coreutils ls
autoreconf --force --install              We need this command to reconfigure the already made previous version
make                                      Compiles the patched coreutils
make install                              Reinstalls the new package

cd ~                                      Enter home directory
coreutils-8.29/src/ls -Aa                 Now the output does not include . and .. , bug fixed!
