This project consists of two bash scripts, buildwords and poornames.

Buildwords uses takes in an HTML webpage and extracts all Hawaiian words from it, sorting them in alphabetical order

Poornames takes in an input directory and an optional recursive (-r) argument and outputs all "poorly named files" within it.
